## Hi there, I'm Ihsan ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about environmental sustainability and cutting edge electrical engineering, and my best work can be found at the intersection of these two areas.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  - Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and sonar at [aiRadar](https://airadar.com).  
  - [electromagagnetic simulation software](https://github.com/ihsan-sa/Lorentz-Solver-V2) for simulating and animating particle paths in complex electromagnetic environments such as nuclear fusors and visualizing their electromagnetic vector fields.  
- âš¡ I've built:
  - a 50kV 100W high volage power converter (HVPC) and electrohydrodynamic/ionic (EHD) thruster to author a research paper on EHD spatial optimization.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning:
  - about nuclear fusion and fusors and am writing software to simulate core concepts along the way.
  - how to run RF simulations in Ansys HFSS.
  - about designing RF systems and Radar.
